## Motor-Driver-PCB

This project contains the PCB design files (schematic and board layout) for the L298N motor driver circuit board I've created using Autodesk Eagle. The fabrication method uses UV exposure ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV_curing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV_curing)) with a laminator, UV oven, sodium hydroxide (etchant), and baking soda for neutralization. The final fabricated PCB is also provided.
